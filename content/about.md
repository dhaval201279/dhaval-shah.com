## About this blog
"Ramblings of Pragmatic Software Craftsman" is a blog where I tend to log my key learnings that I have gathered as part of my day job or as part of my evening / night time where I simply love to play with some new or upcoming technology / tools. This in a way compels me to delve deeper to build a strong conceptual foundation for the article I intend to write about. It gives me immense self gratifying feeling when my readers find my articles insightful - however thats just a byproduct for the endeavor that I put to blog.
